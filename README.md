From a dataset of 80 observations of types of cereal, we are asked to run Ridge regression vs Lasso, and spot the difference in Mean Squared Error while varying the penalty, alpha.
Ridge regressions are often used due to their regularization technique that adds bias to the model to minimize the SSE. 
Lasso performs in a similar way to Ridge regression, however it performs better when there are many useless predictors because Lasso can penalize their coefficient to zero.
